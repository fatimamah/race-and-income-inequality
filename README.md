## What is the context of the work?

Economic inequality is a huge problem in the United States. Wealth distribution is uneven and there are wealth gaps between racial groups. For this project I took the bottom 20% average household income of White, White Alone Not Hispanic, Asian, Hispanic, and Black households and compared them to the top 5% average household income of the same racial groups' households over the years 2002 to 2019. I want to see how they compare to each other and to the GDP per capita over the years, which is theoretically a measure of a persons income.

## What research questions are you trying to answer?

- Is the GDP per capita usually close to a specific racial group's average income?
- Is there a bigger disparity between the top and bottom households in racial groups or between racial groups overall?
- Is economic inequality getting better?

## What are your main findings?

- Economic inequality is getting worse because the rich are getting richer and the poor are stagnant.
- GDP per capita is decreasing and is closer to the bottom 20% household incomes than the top 5%.
- We can assume that the top 5% hoseholds do consistently increase every year, while we can't estimate whether bottom 20% households will increase or decrease.
- There is more inequality between racial groups than inside racial groups.
Overall, the implications is that racial wealth inequality is a real and major problem in the United States.
